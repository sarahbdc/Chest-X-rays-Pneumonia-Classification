# Chest-X-rays-Pneumonia-Classification
Final project DESU Data Science

This dossier is my final project for obtaining the DESU Data Science diploma.

This project was carried out with Chest X-rays data from the Kaggle site. 
These are x-rays of young children who are healthy or who have bacterial or viral pneumonia.

I implemented different deep learning models: MLP, CNN, InceptionV3 and VGG16 combined with an attentional model.
3 notebooks were produced:
- Multiclass classification (Normal vs. Bacterial vs. Viral)
- Binary classification (Normal vs. Pneumonia)
- Binary classification (Bacterial vs. Viral)
